		<h2 class = "headings"> About My Hobbies </h2>
		<!--paragraph about hobbies-->
		<p> Hello! My hobbies can be divided into three sections. Those are: Gaming, Sports, and Music. Below will contain more specific information about those hobbies. </p>
		<h2 class = "headings"> Gaming </h2>
		<!--paragraph about gaming-->
		<p> Currently, my favorite game is VALORANT, a competitive FPS (first-person shooter) game. A close second is Phasmophobia, a co-op indie psychological horror game. Other games that I do play fairly often are League of Legends and Genshin Impact.
		<h4> VALORANT </h4>
		<!--valorant paragraph-->
		<p> VALORANT features many different gamemodes, but the main ones are the ones featured in Unrated and Competitive. There, you play on a team of five against another team of five where your goal is to reach 12 points before the enemy team. <br> My favorite agent is Reyna, although I do play Sova when she isn't available. My highest rank was Silver 3, though I don't usually play ranked to climb. </p>

		<h4> League of Legends </h4>
		<!--league of legends paragraph-->
		<p> League of Legends' main gamemode is summoner's rift, where I play in the top lane with Mordekaiser or Tryndamere. I also play Teemo when I want my opponents to suffer, or Blitzcrank support in the bot lane.</p>

		<h4> Genshin Impact </h4>
		<!--genshin impact paragraph-->
		<p> In Genshin, I am currently Adventure Rank 50 with my main team consisting of Razor (Lvl. 90), Zhongli (Lvl. 80), Xingqiu (Lvl. 80), and Bennett (Lvl. 80). I don't focus on spiral abyss that much, but I did beat floors 1-8 and usually do floor 9. </p>

		<h4> Phasmophobia </h4>
		<!--phasmophobia paragraph-->
		<p> I usually aim for maxouts, which is getting as much money as possible in a single mission. I've beated every map solo except Asylum which I haven't gotten to yet. If you wish to learn more about this game, please click <a href = "phasmophobia_guide.html"> here </a> to see my guide on it.</p>

		<h2 class = "headings"> Sports </h2>
		<!--paragraph about sports-->
		<p> My three favorite sports are Table Tennis, Badminton, and Swimming. Table Tennis and Badminton are non-contact racket sports where you play against an opponent(s), with swimming referring to moving in water from one point to another. </p>
		<h4> Table Tennis </h4>
		<!--table tennis paragraph-->
		<p> I've played Table Tennis competitvely for three years, where I've been training with a coach and went to two competitions with one of the being on a team. It is my favorite sport due to its difficulty yet possible options that present themselves every second. </p>
		<!--video of table tennis training-->

		<video controls id = "badminton-video"> <source src = "assets/badminton_video.mp4" type = "video/mp4"> </video>
		<h4> Swimming </h4>
		<!--swimming paragraph-->
		<p> I've currently doing Bronze Med in swimming (though it isn't available due to COVID). Just like Badminton, I enjoy the physically demanding nature and thinking as to what stroke to use in certian situations. </p>
		<!--video of swimming training-->
		<video controls class = "video"> <source src = "assets/swimming_video.mp4" type = "video/mp4"> </video>
		<h2 class = "headings"> Music </h2>
