		<h3> Future Profession </h3>
		<p> In the future, I wish to become a Family Physician. A Family Physician, also known as a Family Doctor, is a type of doctor that deals with initial checkups and small-end health issues. I would enjoy this style of work due to its low-pressure environment and friendliness regarding patients.<br><br> To support this, I am currently studying within HOSA's Canada Division. HOSA stands for Health Occupations Students of America, and its Canadian division is their group that operates within Canada. They are an organization that provides classes and competitions regarding medical knowledge, which supports the path I wish to pursue in the future.<br><br> For more information regarding HOSA, please click here to visit their website</p>
