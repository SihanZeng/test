	<p> Hello! Welcome to my page about my music studies. Here you will learn about my progress in learning Piano with the <a href = "https://www.rcmusic.com/"> RCM (Royal Conservatory of Music) </a>. <img src = "https://rcmusic-kentico-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/rcm/media/logos/corporate/rcm_logo_white.png"> <br><br> I am currently studying ARCT (the level after level 10) Piano and History. I completed my level 10 Piano exam on June 11, 2021. Below are some videos and photos of my playing. <br> <br> Song 1 (left most): Prelude and Fugue in B flat Major, BWV 866 by Bach | Song 2: Rondo in D Major, K 485 by Mozart | Nocturne in E Minor, op. posth. 72, no. 1 by Chopin | Barcarolle No. 4 in A flat Major, op. 44 by Faur√©.</p>

	<p> By far, my favorite level has been level 9. Looking back, I believe that the songs were at just the right difficulty, where you could appreciate them yet have some mechanically demanding sections. I haven't started studying Harmony yet, but I wish to begin soon and finish ARCT as my final goal in music studies. </p>
